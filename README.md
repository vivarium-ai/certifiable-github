# SpeyTech Organization

This repository provides various default files for other repositories under the organization as described in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

The following files are not treated specially by GitHub and are included here as a convenient convention:

* LICENSE: GitHub requires each repository to include a license file for the repository UI to show the license information. However, every open-source component here uses the same license, so this is an easy reference.
* `.github/workflows/*.yml` are shared workflows that may be used by individual repositories.

# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

The notes below describe the general expectations that apply across repositories.

## Getting started
- Check existing issues and pull requests before starting new work.
- For larger or design-affecting changes, it’s usually best to open an issue first to discuss direction.
- If you’re unsure where to start, look for issues labeled as beginner-friendly or ask in an issue.

## Making changes
- Create a branch for your work.
- Keep changes focused and reasonably sized.
- Add tests when introducing new behavior or fixing bugs.
- Update documentation when user-visible behavior changes.

## Pull requests
- Clearly describe what the change does and why it’s needed.
- Include notes on how the change was tested.
- Keep pull requests limited to a single, coherent improvement.

## Code style and quality
- Follow existing conventions in the codebase.
- Aim for clarity and maintainability.
- Avoid unrelated refactors or formatting changes.

## Communication and conduct
- Be respectful and constructive in all discussions.
- Disagreements are normal; focus on the technical merits of proposals.
- For security issues, please follow the instructions in `SECURITY.md`.

## Licensing
By submitting a contribution, you agree that it will be licensed under the same terms as the project, unless stated otherwise in the repository.

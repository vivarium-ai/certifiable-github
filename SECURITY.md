# Security Policy

TODO: Update as appropriate.

We take security issues seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability:

- **Do not** open a public issue.
- Report it privately using one of the following:
  - GitHub Security Advisories (preferred, if enabled for the repository)
  - Email: security@your-org-domain.example

Please include:
- a clear description of the issue
- affected versions or components
- steps to reproduce, if known
- any relevant logs, traces, or proof-of-concept code

## Response expectations
- We aim to acknowledge reports within a reasonable time frame.
- We will assess the issue and determine appropriate remediation.
- We may ask for additional information to help validate or reproduce the issue.

## Disclosure
- We ask that reporters allow reasonable time for investigation and remediation before public disclosure.
- Coordinated disclosure is preferred.

## Supported versions
Security fixes are typically applied to:
- the current release
- recent supported versions, where feasible

Older or unmaintained versions may not receive fixes.

## Credit
We are happy to acknowledge reporters for valid security disclosures, unless anonymity is requested.

# SpeyTech

**Deterministic computing for safety-critical systems.**

---

## What is this?

Open source tools and libraries for building systems where reproducibility and correctness are non-negotiable. Fixed-point arithmetic, deterministic ML inference, and safety kernel patterns — all designed to support certification under DO-178C, ISO 26262, and IEC 62304.

## Why does it exist?

Floating-point non-determinism, hidden race conditions, and opaque ML models don't belong in systems that control aircraft, medical devices, or vehicles. These projects demonstrate that deterministic alternatives exist — and can be practical.
